Minimalist async evaluation framework for R.

Lightweight parallel code execution, local or distributed across the network.

Designed for simplicity, a 'mirai' evaluates an arbitrary expression asynchronously, resolving automatically upon completion.

Built on 'nanonext' and 'NNG' (Nanomsg Next Gen), uses scalability protocols not subject to R connection limits and transports faster than TCP/IP where applicable.

`mirai()` returns a 'mirai' object immediately. 'mirai' (未来 みらい) is Japanese for 'future'.

The asynchronous 'mirai' task runs in an ephemeral or persistent process, spawned locally or distributed across the network.

{mirai} has a tiny pure R code base, relying solely on {nanonext}, a high-performance binding for the 'NNG' (Nanomsg Next Gen) C library with zero package dependencies.

### Example 1: Compute-intensive Operations

Use case: minimise execution times by performing long-running tasks concurrently in separate processes.

Multiple long computes (model fits etc.) can be performed in parallel on available computing cores.

Use `mirai()` to evaluate an expression asynchronously in a separate, clean R process.

A 'mirai' object is returned immediately.

```{r exec}
library(mirai)

m <- mirai({
  res <- rnorm(n) + m
  res / rev(res)
}, n = 1e8, m = runif(1))

m
```

Above, all named objects are passed through to the mirai.

The 'mirai' yields an 'unresolved' logical NA value whilst the async operation is ongoing.

```{r do}
m$data
```
```{r dowhile, echo=FALSE}
call_mirai(m)
```

Upon completion, the 'mirai' resolves automatically to the evaluated result.

```{r resolv}
m$data |> str()
```

Alternatively, explicitly call and wait for the result using `call_mirai()`.

```{r call}
call_mirai(m)$data |> str()
```

[&laquo; Back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Example 2: I/O-bound Operations

Use case: ensure execution flow of the main process is not blocked.

High-frequency real-time data cannot be written to file/database synchronously without disrupting the execution flow.

Cache data in memory and use `mirai()` to perform periodic write operations concurrently in a separate process.

A 'mirai' object is returned immediately.

Below, '.args' accepts a list of objects already present in the calling environment to be passed to the mirai.

```{r exec2}
library(mirai)

x <- rnorm(1e6)
file <- tempfile()

m <- mirai(write.csv(x, file = file), .args = list(x, file))
```

`unresolved()` may be used in control flow statements to perform actions which depend on resolution of the 'mirai', both before and after.

This means there is no need to actually wait (block) for a 'mirai' to resolve, as the example below demonstrates.

```{r call2}
# unresolved() queries for resolution itself so no need to use it again within the while loop

while (unresolved(m)) {
  cat("while unresolved\n")
  Sys.sleep(0.5)
}

cat("Write complete:", is.null(m$data))

```

Now actions which depend on the resolution may be processed, for example the next write.

### Daemons

Daemons or persistent background processes may be set to receive 'mirai' requests.

This is potentially more efficient as new processes no longer need to be created on an *ad hoc* basis.

#### Passive Queue (default)

Call `daemons()` specifying the number of daemons to launch.

```{r daemons}
daemons(8)
```

```{r daemons2, include=FALSE}
Sys.sleep(0.5)
```

To view the current status, call `daemons()` with no arguments. This provides the number of daemons and active connections.

```{r daemons3}
daemons()
```

In the default implementation, the background processes connect directly into the client and the number of daemons and connections are the same.

This low-level implementation ensures tasks are evenly-distributed amongst daemons, and provides a robust and resource-light solution. This is particularly suited to working with similar-length tasks, or where the number of concurrent tasks typically does not exceed the number of available daemons.

```{r daemons4}
daemons(0)
```

Set the number of daemons to zero to reset. This reverts to the default of creating a new background process for each 'mirai' request.

#### Active Queue

Alternatively, specifying `q` unquoted as a second argument implements an active queue (task scheduler). 

```{r daemonsq}
daemons(8, q)
```
```{r daemonsq2, include=FALSE}
Sys.sleep(0.5)
```

Requesting the status now shows 8 daemons, but only one connection. This is as the queue now sits in the middle, relaying messages between the client and individual daemon processes.

```{r daemonsqv}
daemons()
```

The queue consumes additional resources, however ensures optimal allocation of tasks to daemons such that they are run as soon as resources become available.

```{r daemons5}
daemons(0)
```

Set the number of daemons to zero to reset.

### Distributed Computing

The daemons interface may also be used to send tasks for computation to server processes on the network.

Call `daemons()` specifying as a character string the client network address and a port that is able to accept incoming connections.

As an example: assuming that the local network address of the current machine is '192.168.0.2', and port '5555' has been made available for inbound connections from the local network.

```{r remote, eval=FALSE}
daemons("tcp://192.168.0.2:5555")
```

Alternatively, simply supply a colon followed by the port number to listen on all interfaces on the host, for example:

```{r remotealt}
daemons("tcp://:5555")
```

The network topology is such that the client listens at the above address, and distributes tasks to all connected server processes.

--

On the server, `server()` may be called from an R session, or an Rscript invocation from a shell. This sets up a remote daemon process that connects to the client network IP address and receives tasks:

```
Rscript --vanilla -e 'mirai::server("tcp://192.168.0.2:5555")'
```

Alternatively, specify 'n' to launch an active server queue directing a cluster of 'n' daemons:

```
Rscript --vanilla -e 'mirai::server("tcp://192.168.0.2:5555",n=8)'
```

--

On the client, requesting the status will show daemons as `NA`. However network resources may be added and removed as required, and tasks are automatically distributed to all server processes. The number of connections will show the actual number of instances connected to the client (2 in the example below).

```{r remotes, include=FALSE}
Sys.sleep(1)
```
```{r remotev}
daemons()
```

To reset all connections and revert to default behaviour:

```{r reset}
daemons(0)
```
This also sends an exit signal to connected server instances so that they exit automatically.

### Errors, Interrupts and Timeouts

If execution in a mirai fails, the error message is returned as a character string of class 'miraiError' and 'errorValue' to facilitate debugging. `is_mirai_error()` can be used to test for mirai execution errors.

```{r errorexample}
m1 <- mirai(stop("occurred with a custom message", call. = FALSE))
call_mirai(m1)$data

m2 <- mirai(mirai())
call_mirai(m2)$data

is_mirai_error(m2$data)
is_error_value(m2$data)
```

If during a `call_mirai()` an interrupt e.g. ctrl+c is sent, the mirai will resolve to an empty character string of class 'miraiInterrupt' and 'errorValue'. `is_mirai_interrupt()` may be used to test for such interrupts. 

```{r interruptexample}
is_mirai_interrupt(m2$data)
```

If execution of a mirai surpasses the timeout set via the '.timeout' argument, the mirai will resolve to an 'errorValue'. This can, amongst other things, guard against mirai processes that hang and never return.

```{r timeouts}
m3 <- mirai(nanonext::msleep(1000), .timeout = 500)
call_mirai(m3)$data

is_mirai_error(m3$data)
is_mirai_interrupt(m3$data)
is_error_value(m3$data)
```

`is_error_value()` tests for all mirai execution errors, user interrupts and timeouts.

### Deferred Evaluation Pipe

{mirai} implements a deferred evaluation pipe `%>>%` for working with potentially unresolved values.

Pipe a mirai `$data` value forward into a function or series of functions and it initially returns an 'unresolvedExpr'.

The result may be queried at `$data`, which will return another 'unresolvedExpr' whilst unresolved. However when the original value resolves, the 'unresolvedExpr' will simultaneously resolve into a 'resolvedExpr', for which the evaluated result will be available at `$data`. 

It is possible to use `unresolved()` around a 'unresolvedExpr' or its `$data` element to test for resolution, as in the example below.

The pipe operator semantics are similar to R's base pipe `|>`:

`x %>>% f` is equivalent to `f(x)` <br />
`x %>>% f()` is equivalent to `f(x)` <br />
`x %>>% f(y)` is equivalent to `f(x, y)`

```{r pipe}
m <- mirai({Sys.sleep(0.5); 1})
b <- m$data %>>% c(2, 3) %>>% as.character()
b
b$data
Sys.sleep(1)
b$data
b
```
