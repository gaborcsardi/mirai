Minimalist async evaluation framework for R.

未来 みらい mirai is Japanese for 'future'.

Extremely simple and lightweight method for concurrent / parallel code execution, built on 'nanonext' and 'NNG' (Nanomsg Next Gen) technology.

### Design Notes

Whilst frameworks for parallelisation exist for R, {mirai} is designed for simplicity.

The package provides 2 functions:

 - `eval_mirai()` to evaluate async
 
 - `call_mirai()` to call the result

Demonstrates the capability of {nanonext} in providing a lightweight and robust cross-platform concurrency framework.

{mirai} has a tiny pure R code base, relying on a single package - {nanonext}. 

{nanonext} itself is a lightweight wrapper for the NNG C library with zero package dependencies.

### Installation

Install the latest release from CRAN:

```{r cran, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("mirai")
```

or the development version from rOpenSci R-universe:

```{r runiv, eval=FALSE}
options(repos = c(shikokuchuo = 'https://shikokuchuo.r-universe.dev', CRAN = 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
install.packages("mirai")
```

### Use Cases

Minimise execution times by performing long-running tasks concurrently in separate processes.

Ensure execution flow of the main process is not blocked.

```{r example}
library(mirai)
```

#### Example 1: Compute-intensive Operations

Multiple long computes (model fits etc.) would take more time than if performed concurrently on available computing cores.

Use `eval_mirai()` to evaluate an expression in a separate R process asynchronously.

- All named objects are passed through to a clean environment

A 'mirai' object is returned immediately.

```{r exec, eval=FALSE}
mirai <- eval_mirai(rnorm(n) + m, n = 1e8, m = runif(1))

mirai
#> < mirai >
#>  ~ use call_mirai() to resolve
```

Continue running code concurrent to the async operation.

```{r do, eval=FALSE}
# do more...
```

Use `call_mirai()` to retrieve the evaluated result when required.

```{r call, eval=FALSE}
call_mirai(mirai)

mirai
#> < mirai >
#>  - $value for evaluated result

str(mirai$value)
#> num [1:100000000] 1.485 -0.804 0.965 -0.128 -0.555 ...
```

#### Example 2: I/O-bound Operations

Processing high-frequency real-time data, writing results to file/database can be slow and potentially disrupt the execution flow.

Cache data in memory and use `eval_mirai()` to perform periodic write operations in a separate process. 

A 'mirai' object is returned immediately.

```{r exec2, eval=FALSE}
mirai <- eval_mirai(write.csv(x, file = file), x = rnorm(1e8), file = tempfile())
```

Use `call_mirai()` to confirm the operation has completed.

- This will wait for the operation to complete if it is still ongoing

```{r call2, eval=FALSE}
call_mirai(mirai)$value
#> NULL

```

Above, the return value is called directly. NULL is the expected return value for `write.csv()`.
