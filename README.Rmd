Minimalist async evaluation framework for R.
<br /><br />
Lightweight parallel code execution and distributed computing.
<br /><br />
Designed for simplicity, a 'mirai' evaluates an R expression asynchronously, on local or network resources, resolving automatically upon completion.
<br /><br />
`mirai()` returns a 'mirai' object immediately. 'mirai' (未来 みらい) is Japanese for 'future'.
<br /><br />
Efficient scheduling over fast inter-process communications or secure TLS connections over TCP/IP, built on 'nanonext' and 'NNG' (Nanomsg Next Gen).
<br /><br />
{mirai} has a tiny pure R code base, relying solely on [`nanonext`](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7903429), a high-performance binding for the 'NNG' (Nanomsg Next Gen) C library with zero package dependencies.
<br /><br />

### Installation

Install the latest release from CRAN:

```{r cran, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("mirai")
```

or the development version from rOpenSci R-universe:

```{r runiv, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("mirai", repos = "https://shikokuchuo.r-universe.dev")
```

### Quick Start

Use `mirai()` to evaluate an expression asynchronously in a separate, clean R process.

A 'mirai' object is returned immediately.

```{r exec}
library(mirai)

m <- mirai(
  {
    res <- rnorm(x) + y ^ 2
    res / rev(res)
  },
  x = 10,
  y = runif(1)
)

m
```

Above, all specified `name = value` pairs are passed through to the 'mirai'.

The 'mirai' yields an 'unresolved' logical NA whilst the async operation is ongoing.

```{r do}
m$data
```
```{r dowhile, echo=FALSE}
call_mirai(m)
```

To check whether a mirai has resolved:

```{r unres}
unresolved(m)
```

Upon completion, the 'mirai' resolves automatically to the evaluated result.

```{r resolv}
m$data
```

Alternatively, explicitly call and wait for the result using `call_mirai()`.

```{r call}
call_mirai(m)$data
```

### Daemons

Daemons are persistent background processes created to receive 'mirai' requests. This is potentially more efficient as new processes no longer need to be created on an *ad hoc* basis.

They may be deployed [locally](https://shikokuchuo.net/mirai/articles/mirai.html#daemons-local-persistent-processes) or [remotely](https://shikokuchuo.net/mirai/articles/mirai.html#distributed-computing-remote-daemons), even [launched](https://shikokuchuo.net/mirai/articles/mirai.html#distributed-computing-launching-daemons) across the network via SSH etc., optionally using automatically-configured [secure TLS connections](https://shikokuchuo.net/mirai/articles/mirai.html#distributed-computing-tls-secure-connections).

Refer to the [mirai vignette](https://shikokuchuo.net/mirai/articles/mirai.html) for full package functionality. This may be accessed within R by:

```{r vignette, eval=FALSE}
vignette("mirai", package = "mirai")
```

### Powering Crew and Targets

The [`crew`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=crew) package is a distributed worker-launcher extending {mirai} to different distributed computing platforms, from traditional clusters to cloud services.

[`crew.cluster`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=crew.cluster) enables mirai-based workflows on traditional high-performance computing clusters using:

- LFS
- PBS/TORQUE
- SGE
- SLURM

[`crew.aws.batch`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=crew.aws.batch) extends {mirai} to cloud computing using AWS Batch.

[`targets`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=targets), a Make-like pipeline tool for statistics and data science, has integrated and adopted [`crew`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=crew) as its default high-performance computing backend.

### Parallel Clusters

{mirai} provides an alternative communications backend for R's 'parallel' base package, implementing a low-level feature request by R-Core at [R Project Sprint 2023](https://contributor.r-project.org/r-project-sprint-2023/).

```{r cluster}
cl <- make_cluster(4)
cl
```

A 'miraiCluster' is fully compatible with all 'parallel' functions such as `parallel::clusterApply()` ([further details](https://shikokuchuo.net/mirai/articles/mirai.html#parallel-clusters)).

A 'miraiCluster' may also be registered for use with the [`foreach`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=foreach) package by [`doParallel`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=doParallel).

### Asynchronous Shiny and Plumber Applications

{mirai} serves as a backend for enterprise asynchronous [`shiny`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=shiny) or [`plumber`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=plumber) applications.

A 'mirai' may be used interchangeably with a 'promise' by using the the promise pipe `%...>%`, or explictly by `promises::as.promise()`, allowing side-effects to be performed upon asynchronous resolution of a 'mirai'.

The following example outputs "hello" to the console after one second when the 'mirai' resolves.

```{r promises}
library(promises)
p <- mirai({Sys.sleep(1); "hello"}) %...>% cat()
p
```

Usage examples: [for plumber](https://shikokuchuo.net/mirai/articles/mirai.html#promises-async-plumber-applications).

### Torch Parallelization

The custom serialization interface in {mirai} is accessed via `serialization()`.

In the case of [`torch`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=torch), this requires just the following call at the head of your session:

```{r torch}
serialization(refhook = list(torch::torch_serialize, torch::torch_load))
```

This allows tensors, including complex objects such as models, optimizers etc. to be used seamlessly across local and remote processes in the same way as other R objects ([further details](https://shikokuchuo.net/mirai/articles/mirai.html#custom-serialization-torch-parallelization)).

### Thanks

We would like to thank in particular:

[William Landau](https://github.com/wlandau/), for being instrumental in shaping development of the package, from initiating the original request for persistent daemons, through to orchestrating robustness testing for the high performance computing requirements of [`crew`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=crew) and [`targets`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=targets).

[Henrik Bengtsson](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/), for valuable and incisive insights leading to the interface accepting broader usage patterns.

[Luke Tierney](https://github.com/ltierney/), R Core, for discussion on R's implementation of L'Ecuyer-CMRG streams, used to ensure statistical independence in parallel processing.

[Daniel Falbel](https://github.com/dfalbel/), for discussion around an efficient solution to serialization and transmission of [`torch`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=torch) tensors.
