### みらい
<br />
Minimalist ・ Futuristic ・ Reliable
<br /><br />
Async evaluation framework for R.
<div align = "right"> *mirai パッケージを試してみたところ、かなり速くて驚きました* </div>
Fast parallel code execution and distributed computing.
<br /><br />
`mirai()` returns a 'mirai' object immediately. Designed for simplicity, a 'mirai' evaluates an R expression asynchronously, on local or network resources, resolving automatically upon completion.
<br /><br />
Efficient scheduling over fast inter-process communications or secure TLS connections over TCP/IP, built on the latest [nanonext](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7903429) and [NNG](https://nng.nanomsg.org/) technology.

### Installation

Install the latest release from CRAN:

```{r cran, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("mirai")
```

or the development version from rOpenSci R-universe:

```{r runiv, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("mirai", repos = "https://shikokuchuo.r-universe.dev")
```

### Quick Start

Use `mirai()` to evaluate an expression asynchronously in a separate, clean R process.

A 'mirai' object is returned immediately.

```{r exec}
library(mirai)

m <- mirai(
  {
    res <- rnorm(x) + y ^ 2
    res / rev(res)
  },
  x = 10,
  y = runif(1)
)

m
```

Above, all specified `name = value` pairs are passed through to the 'mirai'.

The 'mirai' yields an 'unresolved' logical NA whilst the async operation is ongoing.

```{r do}
m$data
```
```{r dowhile, echo=FALSE}
call_mirai(m)
```

To check whether a mirai has resolved:

```{r unres}
unresolved(m)
```

Upon completion, the 'mirai' resolves automatically to the evaluated result.

```{r resolv}
m$data
```

Alternatively, explicitly call and wait for the result using `call_mirai()`.

```{r call}
call_mirai(m)$data
```

### Daemons

Daemons are persistent background processes created to receive 'mirai' requests.

They may be deployed for:

[Local](https://shikokuchuo.net/mirai/articles/mirai.html#daemons-local-persistent-processes) parallel processing; or

[Remote](https://shikokuchuo.net/mirai/articles/mirai.html#distributed-computing-remote-daemons) network distributed computing.

[Launchers](https://shikokuchuo.net/mirai/articles/mirai.html#distributed-computing-launching-daemons) allow daemons to be started both on the local machine and across the network via SSH etc.

[Secure TLS connections](https://shikokuchuo.net/mirai/articles/mirai.html#distributed-computing-tls-secure-connections) can be automatically-configured on-the-fly for remote daemon connections.

Refer to the [{mirai} vignette](https://shikokuchuo.net/mirai/articles/mirai.html) for full package functionality. This may be accessed within R by:

```{r vignette, eval=FALSE}
vignette("mirai", package = "mirai")
```

### Integrations

The following core integrations are documented, with usage examples in the linked vignettes:

[{parallel}](https://shikokuchuo.net/mirai/articles/parallel.html) - provides an alternative communications backend for R, implementing a low-level feature request by R-Core at R Project Sprint 2023.

[{promises}](https://shikokuchuo.net/mirai/articles/promises.html) - 'mirai' may be used interchangeably with 'promises' by using the promise pipe `%...>%` or the `as.promise()` method.

[{plumber}](https://shikokuchuo.net/mirai/articles/plumber.html) - serves as an asynchronous / distributed backend, scaling applications via the use of promises.

[{shiny}](https://shikokuchuo.net/mirai/articles/shiny.html) - serves as an asynchronous / distributed backend, plugging directly into the reactive framework without the need for promises.

[{torch}](https://shikokuchuo.net/mirai/articles/torch.html) - the custom serialization interface allows tensors and complex objects such as models and optimizers to be used seamlessly across parallel processes.

### Powering Crew and Targets High Performance Computing

[{targets}](https://cran.r-project.org/package=targets), a Make-like pipeline tool for statistics and data science, has integrated and adopted {crew} as its default high-performance computing backend.

[{crew}](https://cran.r-project.org/package=crew) is a distributed worker-launcher extending {mirai} to different distributed computing platforms, from traditional clusters to cloud services.

[{crew.cluster}](https://cran.r-project.org/package=crew.cluster) enables mirai-based workflows on traditional high-performance computing clusters using LFS, PBS/TORQUE, SGE and SLURM.

[{crew.aws.batch}](https://cran.r-project.org/package=crew.aws.batch) extends {mirai} to cloud computing using AWS Batch.

### Thanks

We would like to thank in particular:

[William Landau](https://github.com/wlandau/), for being instrumental in shaping development of the package, from initiating the original request for persistent daemons, through to orchestrating robustness testing for the high performance computing requirements of {crew} and {targets}.

[Henrik Bengtsson](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/), for valuable and incisive insights leading to the interface accepting broader usage patterns.

[Luke Tierney](https://github.com/ltierney/), R Core, for discussion on R's implementation of L'Ecuyer-CMRG streams, used to ensure statistical independence in parallel processing.

[Daniel Falbel](https://github.com/dfalbel/), for discussion around an efficient solution to serialization and transmission of {torch} tensors.
