\usage{
collect(x, progress = FALSE, stop = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a list of \sQuote{mirai} objects.}

\item{progress}{[default FALSE] if TRUE, reports progress via a simple text
progress indicator.}

\item{stop}{[default FALSE] errors are returned as \sQuote{miraiError} /
\sQuote{errorValue} as the case may be, allowing recovery from partial
failure. If TRUE, performs early stopping as soon as an error is
encountered, with remaining in-progress computations aborted.}
}
\value{
A list, the same length as \sQuote{x}, preserving names.
}
\description{
Collects the results from \code{mirai_map} or any list of \sQuote{mirai}
    objects, waiting for resolution if still in progress.
}
\details{
This function will wait for all asynchronous operations to
    complete if still in progress (blocking, although user-interruptible).

    Optionally shows a simple text progress indicator.

    Allows for early stopping, which stops at the first failure and aborts
    all remaining in-progress computations.
