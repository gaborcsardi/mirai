### Example 1: Compute-intensive Operations

Use case: minimise execution times by performing long-running tasks concurrently in separate processes.

Multiple long computes (model fits etc.) can be performed in parallel on available computing cores.

Use `mirai()` to evaluate an expression asynchronously in a separate, clean R process.

A 'mirai' object is returned immediately.


```r
library(mirai)

m <- mirai(
  {
    res <- rnorm(n) + m
    res / rev(res)
  },
  m = runif(1),
  n = 1e8
)

m
#> < mirai | $data >
```

Above, all specified `name = value` pairs are passed through to the 'mirai'.

The 'mirai' yields an 'unresolved' logical NA whilst the async operation is ongoing.


```r
m$data
#> 'unresolved' logi NA
```


Upon completion, the 'mirai' resolves automatically to the evaluated result.


```r
m$data |> str()
#>  num [1:100000000] 0.684 -7.893 0.775 2.639 -0.713 ...
```

Alternatively, explicitly call and wait for the result using `call_mirai()`.


```r
call_mirai(m)$data |> str()
#>  num [1:100000000] 0.684 -7.893 0.775 2.639 -0.713 ...
```

For easy programmatic use of `mirai()`, '.expr' accepts a pre-constructed language object, and also a list of named arguments passed via '.args'. So, the following would be equivalent to the above:


```r
expr <- quote({
  res <- rnorm(n) + m
  res / rev(res)
})

args <- list(m = runif(1), n = 1e8)

m <- mirai(.expr = expr, .args = args)

call_mirai(m)$data |> str()
#>  num [1:100000000] -1.75537 -0.04664 0.00733 0.03312 0.27412 ...
```

### Example 2: I/O-bound Operations

Use case: ensure execution flow of the main process is not blocked.

High-frequency real-time data cannot be written to file/database synchronously without disrupting the execution flow.

Cache data in memory and use `mirai()` to perform periodic write operations concurrently in a separate process.

Below, '.args' is used to pass a list of objects already present in the calling environment to the mirai by name. This is an alternative use of '.args', and may be combined with `...` to also pass in `name = value` pairs.


```r
library(mirai)

x <- rnorm(1e6)
file <- tempfile()

m <- mirai(write.csv(x, file = file), .args = list(x, file))
```

A 'mirai' object is returned immediately.

`unresolved()` may be used in control flow statements to perform actions which depend on resolution of the 'mirai', both before and after.

This means there is no need to actually wait (block) for a 'mirai' to resolve, as the example below demonstrates.


```r
# unresolved() queries for resolution itself so no need to use it again within the while loop

while (unresolved(m)) {
  cat("while unresolved\n")
  Sys.sleep(0.5)
}
#> while unresolved
#> while unresolved

cat("Write complete:", is.null(m$data))
#> Write complete: TRUE
```

Now actions which depend on the resolution may be processed, for example the next write.

### Example 3: Resilient Pipelines

Use case: isolating code that can potentially fail in a separate process to ensure continued uptime.

As part of a data science / machine learning pipeline, iterations of model training may periodically fail for stochastic and uncontrollable reasons (e.g. buggy memory management on graphics cards).

Running each iteration in a 'mirai' isolates this potentially-problematic code such that even if it does fail, it does not bring down the entire pipeline.


```r
library(mirai)

run_iteration <- function(i) {

  if (runif(1) < 0.1) stop("random error\n", call. = FALSE) # simulates a stochastic error rate
  sprintf("iteration %d successful\n", i)

}

for (i in 1:10) {

  m <- mirai(run_iteration(i), .args = list(run_iteration, i))
  while (is_error_value(call_mirai(m)$data)) {
    cat(m$data)
    m <- mirai(run_iteration(i), .args = list(run_iteration, i))
  }
  cat(m$data)

}
#> iteration 1 successful
#> iteration 2 successful
#> iteration 3 successful
#> iteration 4 successful
#> iteration 5 successful
#> iteration 6 successful
#> iteration 7 successful
#> Error: random error
#> iteration 8 successful
#> iteration 9 successful
#> iteration 10 successful
```

Further, by testing the return value of each 'mirai' for errors, error-handling code is then able to automate recovery and re-attempts, as in the above example. Further details on [error handling](#errors-interrupts-and-timeouts) can be found in the section below.

The end result is a resilient and fault-tolerant pipeline that minimises downtime by eliminating interruptions of long computes.

### Daemons: Local Persistent Processes

Daemons, or persistent background processes, may be set to receive 'mirai' requests.

This is potentially more efficient as new processes no longer need to be created on an *ad hoc* basis.

#### With Dispatcher (default)

Call `daemons()` specifying the number of daemons to launch.


```r
daemons(6)
#> [1] 6
```



To view the current status, `status()` provides the number of active connections along with a matrix of statistics for each daemon.


```r
status()
#> $connections
#> [1] 1
#> 
#> $daemons
#>                                     i online instance assigned complete
#> abstract://d5536b65475a232046163bbe 1      1        1        0        0
#> abstract://7fc3023cb72b596b4e6d0427 2      1        1        0        0
#> abstract://06c60e95499d671fc080522d 3      1        1        0        0
#> abstract://a01df16d6f324c25e4cbd2f6 4      1        1        0        0
#> abstract://0f57a3c84a91603f62f06481 5      1        1        0        0
#> abstract://35c58ff8b4e74811a46f7808 6      1        1        0        0
```

The default `dispatcher = TRUE` creates a `dispatcher()` background process that connects to individual daemon processes on the local machine. This ensures that tasks are dispatched efficiently on a first-in first-out (FIFO) basis to daemons for processing. Tasks are queued at the dispatcher and sent to a daemon as soon as it can accept the task for immediate execution.

Dispatcher uses synchronisation primitives from [`nanonext`](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7903429), waiting upon rather than polling for tasks, which is efficient both in terms of consuming no resources while waiting, and also being fully synchronised with events (having no latency).


```r
daemons(0)
#> [1] 0
```

Set the number of daemons to zero to reset. This reverts to the default of creating a new background process for each 'mirai' request.

#### Without Dispatcher

Alternatively, specifying `dispatcher = FALSE`, the background daemons connect directly to the host process.


```r
daemons(6, dispatcher = FALSE)
#> [1] 6
```


Requesting the status now shows 6 connections, along with the host URL at `$daemons`.


```r
status()
#> $connections
#> [1] 6
#> 
#> $daemons
#> [1] "abstract://3e78fd8940d83598ba069a19"
```

This implementation sends tasks immediately, and ensures that tasks are evenly-distributed amongst daemons. This means that optimal scheduling is not guaranteed as the duration of tasks cannot be known *a priori*. As an example, tasks could be queued at a daemon behind a long-running task, whilst other daemons are idle having already completed their tasks.

The advantage of this approach is that it is low-level and does not require an additional dispatcher process. It is well-suited to working with similar-length tasks, or where the number of concurrent tasks typically does not exceed available daemons.

`everywhere()` may be used to evaluate an expression on all connected daemons and persist the resultant state, regardless of a daemon's 'cleanup' setting.


```r
everywhere(library(parallel))
```

The above keeps the `parallel` package loaded for all evaluations. Other types of setup task may also be performed such as making a common resource available, etc.


```r
daemons(0)
#> [1] 0
```

Set the number of daemons to zero to reset.

#### Everywhere

`everywhere()` may be used to evaluate an expression on all connected daemons and persist the resultant state, regardless of a daemon's 'cleanup' setting. This may be used for performing setup of the evaluation environment, with particular packages loaded, or common resources made available, etc.

### Distributed Computing: Remote Daemons

The daemons interface may also be used to send tasks for computation to remote daemon processes on the network.

Call `daemons()` specifying 'url' as a character string such as: 'tcp://10.75.32.70:5555' at which daemon processes should connect to. Alternatively, use `host_url()` to automatically construct a valid URL.

IPv6 addresses are also supported and must be enclosed in square brackets `[]` to avoid confusion with the final colon separating the port. For example, port 5555 on the IPv6 address `::ffff:a6f:50d` would be specified as `tcp://[::ffff:a6f:50d]:5555`.

For options on actually launching the daemons, please see the next section.

#### Connecting to Remote Daemons Through Dispatcher

The default `dispatcher = TRUE` creates a background `dispatcher()` process on the local machine, which listens to a vector of URLs that remote `daemon()` processes dial in to, with each daemon having its own unique URL.

It is recommended to use a websocket URL starting `ws://` instead of TCP in this scenario (used interchangeably with `tcp://`). A websocket URL supports a path after the port number, which can be made unique for each daemon. In this way a dispatcher can connect to an arbitrary number of daemons over a single port.

Supplying a vector of URLs allows the use of arbitrary port numbers / paths. 'n' does not need to be specified if it can be inferred from the length of the 'url' vector, for example:


```r
daemons(url = c("ws://10.75.32.70:5566/cpu", "ws://10.75.32.70:5566/gpu", "ws://10.75.32.70:7788/1"))
```

Alternatively, below a single URL is supplied, along with `n = 4` to specify that the dispatcher should listen at 4 URLs. In such a case, an integer sequence is automatically appended to the path `/1` through `/4` to produce the URLs.


```r
daemons(n = 4, url = host_url(port = 5555))
#> [1] 4
```

Requesting status on the host machine:


```r
status()
#> $connections
#> [1] 1
#> 
#> $daemons
#>                     i online instance assigned complete
#> tcp://hostname:5555 1      0        0        0        0
#> tcp://hostname:5556 2      0        0        0        0
#> tcp://hostname:5557 3      0        0        0        0
#> tcp://hostname:5558 4      0        0        0        0
```

As per the local case, `$connections` shows the single connection to dispatcher, however `$daemons` now provides a matrix of statistics for the remote daemons.

- `i` index number.
- `online` shows as 1 when there is an active connection, or else 0 if a daemon has yet to connect or has disconnected.
- `instance` increments by 1 every time there is a new connection at a URL. This counter is designed to track new daemon instances connecting after previous ones have ended (due to time-outs etc.). The count becomes negative immediately after a URL is regenerated by `saisei()`, but increments again once a new daemon connects.
- `assigned` shows the cumulative number of tasks assigned to the daemon.
- `complete` shows the cumulative number of tasks completed by the daemon.

Dispatcher automatically adjusts to the number of daemons actually connected. Hence it is possible to dynamically scale up or down the number of daemons according to requirements (limited to the 'n' URLs assigned).

To reset all connections and revert to default behaviour:


```r
daemons(0)
#> [1] 0
```

Closing the connection causes the dispatcher to exit automatically, and in turn all connected daemons when their respective connections with the dispatcher are terminated.

#### Connecting to Remote Daemons Directly

By specifying `dispatcher = FALSE`, remote daemons connect directly to the host process. The host listens at a single URL, and distributes tasks to all connected daemons.


```r
daemons(url = host_url(), dispatcher = FALSE)
#> [1] "tcp://hostname:40729"
```

Note that above, calling `host_url()` without a port value uses the default of '0'. This is a wildcard value that will automatically cause a free ephemeral port to be assigned. The actual assigned port is provided in the return value of the call, or it may be queried at any time via `status()`.

The number of daemons connecting to the host URL is not limited and network resources may be added or removed at any time, with tasks automatically distributed to all connected daemons.

`$connections` will show the actual number of connected daemons.


```r
status()
#> $connections
#> [1] 0
#> 
#> $daemons
#> [1] "tcp://hostname:40729"
```

To reset all connections and revert to default behaviour:


```r
daemons(0)
#> [1] 0
```

This causes all connected daemons to exit automatically.

### Distributed Computing: Launching Daemons

To launch remote daemons, supply a remote launch configuration to the 'remote' argument of `daemons()` when setting up daemons, or `launch_remote()` at any time afterwards.

`ssh_config()` may be used to generate a remote launch configuration if there is SSH access to the remote machine, or else `remote_config()` provides a flexible method for generating a configuration involving a custom resource manager / application.

#### SSH Direct Connection

The first example below launches 4 daemons on the machine 10.75.32.90 (using the default SSH port of 22 as this was not specified), connecting back to the dispatcher URLs:


```r
daemons(
  n = 4,
  url = host_url(ws = TRUE, port = 5555),
  remote = ssh_config(remotes = "ssh://10.75.32.90")
)
```
The second example below launches one daemon on each of 10.75.32.90 and 10.75.32.91 using the custom SSH port of 222:


```r
daemons(
  n = 2,
  url = host_url(ws = TRUE, port = 5555),
  remote = ssh_config(c("ssh://10.75.32.90:222", "ssh://10.75.32.91:222"))
)
```
In the above examples, as the remote daemons connect back directly, port 5555 on the local machine must be open to incoming connections from the remote addresses.

#### SSH Tunnelling

Use of SSH tunnelling provides a convenient way to launch remote daemons without requiring the remote machine to be able to access the host. Often firewall configurations or security policies may prevent opening a port to accept outside connections.

In these cases SSH tunnelling offers a solution by creating a tunnel once the initial SSH connection is made. For simplicity, this SSH tunnelling implementation uses the same port on both the side of the host and that of the corresponding node. SSH key-based authentication must also already be in place.

Tunnelling requires the hostname for 'url' specified when setting up daemons to be either '127.0.0.1' or 'localhost'. This is as the tunnel is created between 127.0.0.1:port or equivalently localhost:port on each machine. The host listens to its localhost:port and the remotes each dial into localhost:port on their own respective machines.

The below example launches 2 nodes on the remote machine 10.75.32.90 using SSH tunnelling over port 5555 ('url' hostname is specified as 'localhost'):


```r
daemons(
  url = "tcp://localhost:5555",
  remote = ssh_config(
    remotes = c("ssh://10.75.32.90", "ssh://10.75.32.90"),
    tunnel = TRUE
  )
)
```

#### Manual Deployment

As an alternative to automated launches, calling `launch_remote()` without specifying 'remote' may be used to return the shell commands for deploying daemons manually. The printed return values may be copy / pasted directly to a remote machine.


```r
daemons(n = 2, url = host_url())
#> [1] 2

launch_remote(1:2)
#> [1]
#> Rscript -e "mirai::daemon('tcp://hostname:45703',rs=c(10407,1915951292,602430093,-399070230,1718389859,342913608,-2044646487))"
#> 
#> [2]
#> Rscript -e "mirai::daemon('tcp://hostname:40897',rs=c(10407,-1828158877,1622854652,-486616264,-1055165941,1370591224,-1699027618))"

daemons(0)
#> [1] 0
```

Note that `daemons()` should be set up on the host machine before launching `daemon()` on remote resources, otherwise the daemon instances will exit if a connection is not immediately available. Alternatively, specifying the argument `autoexit = FALSE` will allow daemons to wait (indefinitely) for a connection to become available.

[&laquo; Back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Distributed Computing: TLS Secure Connections

TLS is available as an option to secure communications from the local machine to remote daemons.

#### Zero-configuration

An automatic zero-configuration default is implemented. Simply specify a secure URL of the form `wss://` or `tls+tcp://` when setting daemons, or use `host_url(tls = TRUE)`, for example:


```r
daemons(n = 4, url = host_url(ws = TRUE, tls = TRUE))
#> [1] 4
```

Single-use keys and certificates are automatically generated and configured, without requiring any further intervention. The private key is always retained on the host machine and never transmitted.

The generated self-signed certificate is available via `launch_remote()`. This function conveniently constructs the full shell command to launch a daemon, including the correctly specified 'tls' argument to `daemon()`.


```r
launch_remote(1)
#> [1]
#> Rscript -e "mirai::daemon('wss://hostname:42913/1',tls=c('-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----

#### CA Signed Certificates

As an alternative to the zero-configuration default, a certificate may also be generated via a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) to a Certificate Authority (CA), which may be a public CA or a CA internal to an organisation.

1. Generate a private key and CSR. The following resources describe how to do so:

- using Mbed TLS: <https://mbed-tls.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kb/how-to/generate-a-certificate-request-csr/>
- using OpenSSL: <https://www.feistyduck.com/library/openssl-cookbook/online/> (Chapter 1.2 Key and Certificate Management)

2. Provide the generated CSR to the CA for it to sign a new TLS certificate.

- The common name (CN) of the certificate must be identical to the hostname or IP address actually used for the connection as it is verified, and will fail if not the same.
- The received certificate should comprise a block of cipher text between the markers `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` and `-----END CERTIFICATE-----`. Make sure to request the certificate in the PEM format. If only available in other formats, the TLS library used should usually provide conversion utilities.
- Check also that the private key is a block of cipher text between the markers `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END PRIVATE KEY-----`.

3. When setting daemons, the TLS certificate and private key should be provided to the 'tls' argument of `daemons()`.

- If the certificate and private key have been imported as character strings `cert` and `key` respectively, then the 'tls' argument may be specified as the character vector `c(cert, key)`.
- Alternatively, the certificate may be copied to a new text file, with the private key appended, in which case the path/filename of this file may be provided to the 'tls' argument.

4. When launching daemons, the certificate chain to the CA should be supplied to the 'tls' argument of `daemon()` or `launch_remote()`.

- The certificate chain should comprise multiple certificates, each between `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` and `-----END CERTIFICATE-----` markers. The first one should be the newly-generated TLS certificate, the same supplied to `daemons()`, and the final one should be a CA root certificate.
- These are the only certificates required if the certificate was signed directly by a CA. If not, then the intermediate certificates should be included in a certificate chain that starts with the TLS certificate and ends with the certificate of the CA.
- If these are concatenated together as a single character string `certchain`, then the character vector comprising this and an empty character string `c(certchain, "")` may be supplied to the relevant 'tls' argument.
- Alternatively, if these are written to a file (and the file replicated on the remote machines), then the 'tls' argument may also be specified as a path/filename (assuming these are the same on each machine).

[&laquo; Back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Compute Profiles

The `daemons()` interface also allows the specification of compute profiles for managing tasks with heterogeneous compute requirements:

- send tasks to different daemons or clusters of daemons with the appropriate specifications (in terms of CPUs / memory / GPU / accelerators etc.)
- split tasks between local and remote computation

Simply specify the argument `.compute` when calling `daemons()` with a profile name (which is 'default' for the default profile). The daemons settings are saved under the named profile.

To create a 'mirai' task using a specific compute profile, specify the '.compute' argument to `mirai()`, which defaults to the 'default' compute profile.

Similarly, functions such as `status()`, `launch_local()` or `launch_remote()` should be specified with the desired '.compute' argument.

### Errors, Interrupts and Timeouts

If execution in a mirai fails, the error message is returned as a character string of class 'miraiError' and 'errorValue' to facilitate debugging. `is_mirai_error()` may be used to test for mirai execution errors.


```r
m1 <- mirai(stop("occurred with a custom message", call. = FALSE))
call_mirai(m1)$data
#> 'miraiError' chr Error: occurred with a custom message

m2 <- mirai(mirai::mirai())
call_mirai(m2)$data
#> 'miraiError' chr Error in mirai::mirai(): missing expression, perhaps wrap in {}?

is_mirai_error(m2$data)
#> [1] TRUE
is_error_value(m2$data)
#> [1] TRUE
```

If a daemon instance is sent a user interrupt, the mirai will resolve to an empty character string of class 'miraiInterrupt' and 'errorValue'. `is_mirai_interrupt()` may be used to test for such interrupts.


```r
is_mirai_interrupt(m2$data)
#> [1] FALSE
```

If execution of a mirai surpasses the timeout set via the '.timeout' argument, the mirai will resolve to an 'errorValue'. This can, amongst other things, guard against mirai processes that have the potential to hang and never return.


```r
m3 <- mirai(nanonext::msleep(1000), .timeout = 500)
call_mirai(m3)$data
#> 'errorValue' int 5 | Timed out

is_mirai_error(m3$data)
#> [1] FALSE
is_mirai_interrupt(m3$data)
#> [1] FALSE
is_error_value(m3$data)
#> [1] TRUE
```

`is_error_value()` tests for all mirai execution errors, user interrupts and timeouts.

### Parallel Clusters

`mirai` provides an (experimental) alternative communications backend for R. This functionality was developed to fulfil a request by R Core at R Project Sprint 2023.

`make_cluster()` creates a cluster object of class 'miraiCluster', which may be used for any function in the `parallel` base package such as `parallel::clusterApply()`, `parallel::parLapply()` or the load-balanced version `parallel::parLapplyLB()`.

  + Specify 'n' to launch nodes on the local machine.
  + Specify 'url' for receiving connections from remote nodes.
  + Optionally, specify 'remote' to launch remote daemons using a remote configuration generated by `remote_config()` or `ssh_config()`, or else the shell commands for manual deployment of nodes are printed to the console.
  + `status()` may be called on a 'miraiCluster` to query the number of connected nodes at any time.


```r
cl <- make_cluster(4)
cl
#> < miraiCluster | ID: `1` nodes: 4 active: TRUE >

parallel::parLapply(cl, iris, mean)
#> $Sepal.Length
#> [1] 5.843333
#> 
#> $Sepal.Width
#> [1] 3.057333
#> 
#> $Petal.Length
#> [1] 3.758
#> 
#> $Petal.Width
#> [1] 1.199333
#> 
#> $Species
#> [1] NA

status(cl)
#> $connections
#> [1] 2
#> 
#> $daemons
#> [1] "abstract://b54f6b3c1f8cdcc0e8bea9be"

stop_cluster(cl)

cl <- make_cluster(n = 2, url = host_url())
#> Shell commands for deployment on nodes:
#> 
#> [1]
#> Rscript -e "mirai::daemon('tcp://hostname:37177',rs=c(10407,236067212,1230410013,-1328698054,-1279678093,45778968,811610937))"
#> 
#> [2]
#> Rscript -e "mirai::daemon('tcp://hostname:37177',rs=c(10407,-9427494,-421994692,-1307624249,143395137,2059568915,2042720492))"

stop_cluster(cl)
```

Created clusters are fully compatible with `parallel` cluster types.

They may be registered by package [`doParallel`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=doParallel) for use with the [`foreach`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=foreach) package.

### Async Shiny Applications

#### Shiny Example Usage

{mirai} may be used to scale enterprise Shiny applications and plugs straight into the reactive framework, without the need to use promises.

The following example has a button to submit tasks, which will be processed by one of 5 daemons, outputting a pretty spiral pattern upon completion.

You will find that if you submit more than 5 tasks that the chart updates 5 at a time, limited by the parallel capacity of the application.


```r
library(mirai)
library(shiny)
library(ggplot2)
library(aRtsy)

run_task <- function() {
  Sys.sleep(5L)
  list(
    colors = aRtsy::colorPalette(name = "random", n = 3),
    angle = runif(n = 1, min = - 2 * pi, max = 2 * pi),
    size = 1,
    p = 1
  )
}

plot_result <- function(result) {
  do.call(what = canvas_phyllotaxis, args = result)
}

status_message <- function(tasks) {
  if (tasks == 0L) {
    "All tasks completed."
  } else {
    sprintf("%d task%s in progress at %s", tasks, if (tasks > 1L) "s" else "", format.POSIXct(Sys.time()))
  }
}

ui <- fluidPage(
  actionButton("task", "Submit a task (5 seconds)"),
  textOutput("status"),
  plotOutput("result")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  # reactive values and outputs
  reactive_result <- reactiveVal(ggplot())
  reactive_status <- reactiveVal("No task submitted yet.")
  output$result <- renderPlot(reactive_result(), height = 600, width = 600)
  output$status <- renderText(reactive_status())
  poll_for_results <- reactiveVal(FALSE)

  # mirai setup - 5 local daemons with dispatcher
  daemons(5L)
  onStop(function() daemons(0L))
  q <- list()

  # button to submit a task
  observeEvent(input$task, {
    q[[length(q) + 1L]] <<- mirai(run_task(), run_task = run_task)
    poll_for_results(TRUE)
  })

  # event loop to collect finished tasks
  observe({
    req(poll_for_results())
    invalidateLater(millis = 250)
    if (length(q)) {
      if (!unresolved(q[[1L]])) {
        reactive_result(plot_result(q[[1L]][["data"]]))
        q[[1L]] <<- NULL
      }
      reactive_status(status_message(length(q)))
    } else {
      poll_for_results(FALSE)
    }
  })
}

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```
*Thanks to Daniel Woodie and William Landau for providing the original example on which this is based.*

#### Example Using Promises

Alternatively, a 'mirai' may be used as a promise as it supplies its own `as.promise()` method.

A 'mirai' may be piped directly using the promise pipe `&...>%`, which implicitly calls `as.promise()` on the 'mirai', or converted into a promise by `as.promise()`, which then allows using the methods `$then()`, `$finally()` etc.

The below example simulates a plot function requiring a long compute in a ‘shiny’ app.

This app takes c. 2s to start compared to the 8s it would otherwise take if not running in parallel.


```r
library(shiny)
library(promises) # for promise pipe

daemons(4L) # handle 4 simulateneous computes

ui <- fluidPage(
  fluidRow(
    plotOutput("one"),
    plotOutput("two"),
  ),
  fluidRow(
    plotOutput("three"),
    plotOutput("four"),
  )
)

make_plot <- function(time) {
  Sys.sleep(time)
  runif(10)
}

args <- list(make_plot = make_plot, time = 2)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$one <- renderPlot(mirai(make_plot(time), .args = args) %...>% plot())
  output$two <- renderPlot(mirai(make_plot(time), .args = args) %...>% plot())
  output$three <- renderPlot(mirai(make_plot(time), .args = args) %...>% plot())
  output$four <- renderPlot(mirai(make_plot(time), .args = args) %...>% plot())
  session$onSessionEnded(stopApp)
}

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

### Promises: Async Plumber Applications

'mirai' supplies its own `as.promise()` method, allowing it to be used as a promise.

A 'mirai' may be piped directly using the promise pipe `&...>%`, which implicitly calls `as.promise()` on the 'mirai', or converted into a promise by `as.promise()`, which then allows using the methods `$then()`, `$finally()` etc.

Below we provide example usage of how to use mirai as an async distributed backend for {plumber} pipelines.

The plumber router code is run in a daemon process itself so that it does not block the interactive process. It is important to set up this daemon with the argument `autoexit = tools::SIGINT`, so that the plumber server is interrupted and exits cleanly when we tear it down.

#### Example GET Endpoint

The /echo endpoint takes a GET request, sleeps for 1 second (simulating an expensive computation) and just returns the 'msg' request header together with a timestamp and the process ID of the process it is run on.


```r
library(mirai)

daemons(1L, dispatcher = FALSE, autoexit = tools::SIGINT)
#> [1] 1

m <- mirai({
  library(plumber)
  library(promises) # to provide the promise pipe
  library(mirai)

  daemons(4L, dispatcher = FALSE) # handles 4 requests simultaneously
  # does not use dispatcher (suitable when all requests require similar compute)

  pr() |>
    pr_get(
      "/echo",
      function(req, res) {
        mirai(
          {
            Sys.sleep(1L)
            list(status = 200L, body = list(time = format(Sys.time()),
                                            msg = req[["HEADERS"]][["msg"]],
                                            pid = Sys.getpid()))
          },
          req = req
        ) %...>% (function(x) {
          res$status <- x$status
          res$body <- x$body
        })
      }
    ) |>
    pr_run(host = "127.0.0.1", port = 8985)
})
```

The API can be queried using an async HTTP client such as `nanonext::ncurl_aio()`.

Here, all 8 requests are submitted at once, but we note that that responses have differing timestamps as only 4 can be processed at any given time.


```r
library(nanonext)
res <- lapply(1:8,
              function(i) ncurl_aio("http://127.0.0.1:8985/echo",
                                    headers = c(msg = as.character(i))))
res <- lapply(res, call_aio)
for (r in res) print(r$data)
#> [1] "{\"time\":[\"2024-01-09 14:17:05\"],\"msg\":[\"1\"],\"pid\":[22578]}"
#> [1] "{\"time\":[\"2024-01-09 14:17:05\"],\"msg\":[\"2\"],\"pid\":[22572]}"
#> [1] "{\"time\":[\"2024-01-09 14:17:06\"],\"msg\":[\"3\"],\"pid\":[22578]}"
#> [1] "{\"time\":[\"2024-01-09 14:17:06\"],\"msg\":[\"4\"],\"pid\":[22575]}"
#> [1] "{\"time\":[\"2024-01-09 14:17:05\"],\"msg\":[\"5\"],\"pid\":[22575]}"
#> [1] "{\"time\":[\"2024-01-09 14:17:06\"],\"msg\":[\"6\"],\"pid\":[22570]}"
#> [1] "{\"time\":[\"2024-01-09 14:17:05\"],\"msg\":[\"7\"],\"pid\":[22570]}"
#> [1] "{\"time\":[\"2024-01-09 14:17:06\"],\"msg\":[\"8\"],\"pid\":[22572]}"

daemons(0)
#> [1] 0
```

#### Example POST Endpoint

Below is a demonstration of the equivalent using a POST endpoint, accepting a JSON instruction sent as request data.

It is important to note in this case that `req$postBody` should be accessed in the router process and passed in as an argument to the 'mirai' as this is retrieved using a connection that is not serializable.


```r
library(mirai)

daemons(1L, dispatcher = FALSE, autoexit = tools::SIGINT)
#> [1] 1

m <- mirai({
  library(plumber)
  library(promises) # to provide the promise pipe
  library(mirai)

  daemons(4L) # handles 4 requests simultaneously
  # uses dispatcher (suitable for requests with differing compute lengths)

  pr() |>
    pr_post(
      "/echo",
      function(req, res) {
        mirai(
          {
            Sys.sleep(1L) # simulate expensive computation
            list(status = 200L,
                 body = list(time = format(Sys.time()),
                             msg = jsonlite::fromJSON(data)[["msg"]],
                             pid = Sys.getpid()))
          },
          data = req$postBody
        ) %...>% (function(x) {
          res$status <- x$status
          res$body <- x$body
        })
      }
    ) |>
    pr_run(host = "127.0.0.1", port = 8986)
})
```

Querying the endpoint produces the same set of outputs as the previous example.


```r
library(nanonext)
res <- lapply(1:8,
              function(i) ncurl_aio("http://127.0.0.1:8986/echo",
                                    method = "POST",
                                    data = sprintf('{"msg":"%d"}', i)))
res <- lapply(res, call_aio)
for (r in res) print(r$data)
#> [1] "{\"time\":[\"2024-01-09 14:17:09\"],\"msg\":[\"1\"],\"pid\":[22853]}"
#> [1] "{\"time\":[\"2024-01-09 14:17:10\"],\"msg\":[\"2\"],\"pid\":[22855]}"
#> [1] "{\"time\":[\"2024-01-09 14:17:11\"],\"msg\":[\"3\"],\"pid\":[22858]}"
#> [1] "{\"time\":[\"2024-01-09 14:17:10\"],\"msg\":[\"4\"],\"pid\":[22858]}"

### Custom Serialization: Torch Parallelization

Custom serialization functions may be registered to handle external pointer type reference objects.

This allows tensors from the [`torch`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=torch) package to be used seamlessly in 'mirai' computations.

1. Register the serialization and unserialization functions as a list supplied to the 'refhook' argument of `serialization()`.

2. Set up dameons - this may be done before or after setting `serialization()`.

3. Use `everywhere()` to make the 'torch' package available on all dameons (for convenience, optional).


```r
library(torch)
serialization(refhook = list(torch:::torch_serialize, torch::torch_load))
daemons(1)
#> [1] 1
everywhere(library(torch))
```

The below example creates a convolutional neural network using `torch::nn_module()`, which is then passed a set of parameters and initialized within a 'mirai'.


```r
model <- nn_module(
  initialize = function(in_size, out_size) {
    self$conv1 <- nn_conv2d(in_size, out_size, 5)
    self$conv2 <- nn_conv2d(in_size, out_size, 5)
  },
  forward = function(x) {
    x <- self$conv1(x)
    x <- nnf_relu(x)
    x <- self$conv2(x)
    x <- nnf_relu(x)
    x
  }
)

params <- list(in_size = 1, out_size = 20)

m <- mirai(do.call(model, params), .args = list(model, params))
call_mirai(m)$data
#> An `nn_module` containing 1,040 parameters.
#> 
#> ── Modules ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#> • conv1: <nn_conv2d> #520 parameters
#> • conv2: <nn_conv2d> #520 parameters
```
The returned model is an object containing many tensor elements. The model parameters can then be further passed to an optimiser, with that also initialized within a 'mirai' process.


```r
optim <- mirai(optim_rmsprop(params = params), params = m$data$parameters)
call_mirai(optim)$data
#> <optim_rmsprop>
#>   Inherits from: <torch_optimizer>
#>   Public:
#>     add_param_group: function (param_group) 
#>     clone: function (deep = FALSE) 
#>     defaults: list
#>     initialize: function (params, lr = 0.01, alpha = 0.99, eps = 1e-08, weight_decay = 0, 
#>     load_state_dict: function (state_dict, ..., .refer_to_state_dict = FALSE) 
#>     param_groups: list
#>     state: State, R6
#>     state_dict: function () 
#>     step: function (closure = NULL) 
#>     zero_grad: function () 
#>   Private:
#>     step_helper: function (closure, loop_fun)

daemons(0)
#> [1] 0
```
Above, tensors and complex objects containing tensors were passed seamlessly between host and daemon processes, in the same way as any other R object.

The implementation leverages R's own native 'refhook' mechanism to allow such completely transparent usage, and is designed to be fast and efficient using the serialization methods from the 'torch' package directly, minimising data copies where possible.
